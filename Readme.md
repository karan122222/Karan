# Title
Designing a MongoDB Document Database for Quality Control

## Executive Summary
This project aims to design a MongoDB document database for quality control processes. Quality control is crucial in various industries to ensure products meet standards and specifications. By implementing a MongoDB database, we can efficiently store and query data related to quality control metrics, improving overall process efficiency.

## Project Requirements
- Implement a MongoDB document database for quality control.
- Design collections to store relevant data.
- Ensure efficient querying of data for analysis and reporting purposes.

## Data Model
### Collection 1: Products
- **Description**: Stores information about products being manufactured or processed.
- **Fields**:
  - `_id`: Unique identifier for the product.
  - `name`: Name of the product.
  - `category`: Category of the product.
  - `manufacturer`: Manufacturer of the product.
  - `production_date`: Date when the product was manufactured.
  - `expiry_date`: Expiry date of the product.

### Collection 2: Defects
- **Description**: Records information about defects found during quality control inspections.
- **Fields**:
  - `_id`: Unique identifier for the defect.
  - `product_id`: Reference to the product associated with the defect.
  - `defect_type`: Type of defect identified.
  - `defect_description`: Description of the defect.
  - `date_detected`: Date when the defect was detected.

### Collection 3: Inspections
- **Description**: Stores details of quality control inspections conducted.
- **Fields**:
  - `_id`: Unique identifier for the inspection.
  - `product_id`: Reference to the product inspected.
  - `inspector`: Name of the inspector.
  - `inspection_date`: Date when the inspection took place.
  - `pass`: Boolean indicating whether the product passed the inspection or not.
  - `defects`: Array of defects found during the inspection.

### Collection 4: Suppliers
- **Description**: Contains information about suppliers providing raw materials.
- **Fields**:
  - `_id`: Unique identifier for the supplier.
  - `name`: Name of the supplier.
  - `address`: Address of the supplier.
  - `contact`: Contact information of the supplier.

### Collection 5: Employees
- **Description**: Stores data related to employees involved in quality control processes.
- **Fields**:
  - `_id`: Unique identifier for the employee.
  - `name`: Name of the employee.
  - `department`: Department to which the employee belongs.
  - `role`: Role or position of the employee.

## Conclusion
Designing a MongoDB document database for quality control provides a scalable and efficient solution for managing quality-related data. By structuring the database with relevant collections and fields, we can streamline data storage and retrieval processes, facilitating effective quality control monitoring and analysis.
